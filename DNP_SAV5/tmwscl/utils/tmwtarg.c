 * NOTES:
 *  - The Source Code Library will usually use a timeout value of 0;
 *    This indicates the call to tmwtarg_receive should be nonblocking
 *    (i.e., return 0 if no bytes are available.)
 *  - For Modbus RTU this function should not return any bytes
 *    until either the entire frame was received or an inter Character Timeout
 *    occurred. If you are implementing multiple protocols, one of which is
 *    Modbus RTU, then the pContext structure should include a flag that
 *    indicates whether full frames are required. The target implementation
 *    of tmwtarg_receive can use this indicator to ensure that it returns
 *    the entire frame for Modbus RTU. Other protocols can use this
 *    indicator to allow them to return any number of bytes actually
 *    read.
